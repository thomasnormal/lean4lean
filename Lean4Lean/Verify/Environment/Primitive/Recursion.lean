/-! ### Well-founded recursion

`unfoldNatWellFounded` reduces the definition's value to a `WellFounded.Nat.fix` application and
checks a chain of unfoldings. Its output is the equation body with recursive calls pointing at the
value under test, and what it certifies is the collection of definitional equations below.

`Nat.fix h F x` is *not* definitionally `F x (fun y _ => Nat.fix h F y)` -- `Nat.fix_eq` is a
theorem, proved through `go_congr`, and the `Nat.eager` gadget in the fuel deliberately blocks
reduction until the measure evaluates to a numeral. So the caller cannot get the unfolding in one
step; it has to consume fuel, which is why `goFn` and `F` are part of this interface rather than
hidden. The proof terms `goFn` takes are threaded but never inspected: the recognizer does not
check that they live in a proof-irrelevant position, so they are just expressions that grow as the
fuel is consumed. -/

/-! ### Ground judgements

The statements the caller ends up proving are about *closed* terms: `HasPrimitives` is a fact
about the empty context, and for `Nat.bitwise` the operator is a variable of the recognizer's
context whose evaluation behaviour only exists once it is instantiated. So the recognizer's
own context is closed off with `Ctx.Closing` and everything below is stated at `[]`. The
abbreviations themselves are at the top of the file, with the rest of the `VContext` vocabulary. -/

/-- What `unfoldNatWellFounded` hands back: the fixpoint functional `F`, which does not mention
the recursion variables at all; the packer `pack`, a closed lambda over them; and the `ih`
domain `dom`, which is a *single* expression with the packed argument as `bvar 0`, read off
`F`'s type rather than abstracted over the telescope. `c` is the context the recognizer ran in,
which is *not* the context a probe runs in -- probes bind the variables of a pattern, and
different patterns bind different variables. -/
structure ProbeBundle (c : VContext) extends Probe where
  (F' : VExpr) (hF : c.TrExprS F F')
  (pack' : VExpr) (hpack : c.TrExprS pack pack')
  (dom' : VExpr) (hdom : c.TrExprS dom dom')
  /-- The type a packed argument has to have. The recognizer reads it off `whnf (inferType F)` --
  it is `F`'s domain -- and builds `dom` as a lambda over it, so these two typings are exactly
  what it can certify about the pieces, and both are stated in the recognizer's own context
  because `F` and `dom` are telescope-free.

  Nothing here relates `Aty` to `pack`. The recognizer never checks that the packer lands in it:
  `pack` is `mkLambda fvs a₀`, whose result type is `inferType a₀`, and the only thing tested
  against that type is `f`, not `F`. So "this argument is a `Aty`" is a hypothesis of `applied`,
  which is where a caller that knows its own pattern discharges it. -/

  /-- The packer *is* a lambda telescope over the recursion domains, and its body has type `Aty` --

type, and the equation's left hand side is well typed. `Δ` is the probe's context, which extends
the recognizer's by whatever variables the pattern binds.

The argument is abstract. A probe applies `F` and `dom` to `mkAppN pack sub`, but nothing here
depends on its being *that*; what is needed is its translation and that it is an `Aty`, and both
of those are the caller's, since only the caller knows the pattern it packed. -/

/-! ### The fuel induction

`Nat.fix` is entered at fuel `measure x + 1` and each `Nat.rec` step spends one unit, so a value
is reached exactly when the fuel stays ahead of the measure. `Done` is one such step with the
recursive calls already discharged, and the induction below turns it into the reflection fact.

The induction is on the *fuel*, not on the argument: the recursive call is at a smaller measure
but the fuel it is given is whatever the outer call had left, so an induction on the argument
would not line the two up. `GoConverges` is the induction hypothesis, and the outer statement is
that hypothesis at fuel `σm a + 1`. -/

/-- What the fuel induction needs from the recognizer's checks, at ground arguments. This is not
a transcript of those checks: the `fix` delta step and the `eager` gadget are folded into
`entry`, since all they achieve is putting a *numeral* in the fuel position, and the beta steps
that turn the `Nat.rec` iota rule into a usable `ih` are folded into `step`. `F` is a single
expression because the recognizer asserts it does not mention the recursion variables.

`go` is *not*. It is the `Nat.fix.go` constant at `α`, `motive`, `f` and `F`, and only the last
of those is checked telescope-free, so closing the telescope at the arguments `σ a` may leave a
different term for each `a` -- hence `goFn : α → VExpr`. What saves the induction is that the
recognizer verifies the `go` equation with *every* argument of `go` bound (`lambdaTelescope go'`
rebinds `α`, `motive`, `f`, `F`, `t`), so `step` holds at whichever base point `b` one picks,
uniformly in the argument `a` it is used at. The fuel induction then runs at a fixed `b` and
`reflects` takes `b := a`, which is the base point `entry` hands it. Only the types of `ih` and
the call to `F` have to be base-independent, and they are, being built from `F` and `dom`.

The two axes of instantiation are separate. `γ` closes the *recognizer's* context, which does
not vary with the recursion: for `Nat.bitwise` it is the `Bool` operator the definition is
applied to, and it is what makes the statement ground. `α` indexes the *recursion* arguments,
which are literals and hence already closed. `R` is quantified after `γ` at the use site, so it
may depend on what `γ` denotes -- `Nat.bitwise`'s answer is a function of the operator.

The `ih` domain is not a family: `F` has one type, and `Dom` is its codomain's domain, so the
domain at `a` is `Dom.app (A a)`. -/

/-- One `probe` call. It introduces the `ih` binder and hands the caller's builder the equation
`F a ih ≡ rhs` -- as an implication into whatever the caller wants to conclude, since `probe`
returns `Unit` and there is nowhere else to put it.

`replaceFVars` does not appear: applying the bundle's abstractions to `subst` is exactly what
`hτ` expresses on the translation side. `fail` is the caller's, so it is a hypothesis here
rather than a field of the bundle.

The probe runs in `mp`, any extension of the recognizer's own `m` -- these are the pattern's
variables, and each probe may bind a different number of them; `W` is that extension. The
bundle's translations are closed, so they need no lifting; only `τ` does.

`hFV` owes the right hand side's well-formedness: `probe` typechecks it, and `checkType` is only
specified on terms whose free variables are in the context. The left hand side needs no such
hypothesis -- it is built from the bundle and `subst`, whose translations already place their
variables.

The conclusion is `Done`'s shape: an arbitrary closing `γ` of the probe's own variables, an
arbitrary *closed* `ih` of the domain type, and the equation between closed terms. The `ih`
binder does not appear -- neither the context it extends nor its translation `.bvar 0` -- so a
caller never instantiates a telescope. What replaces the syntactic `Q` of an earlier version is
`R`, the caller's *semantic* description of the right hand side; `hR` owes it, and gets the
closing of the probe's own context (`hcl`) to discharge it with, since that is the one thing it
cannot build without naming the binder's type. Both hypotheses are plain propositions about
`mkRhs (.fvar id)`: `mkRhs` is a function, so nothing here is monadic. -/

/-! ### The `go` step equation, one telescope at a time

`go α motive f F (succ t) x hfuel ≡ F x fun y hy => go α motive f F t y pf` is checked with every
argument of `go` still bound -- that is what makes it uniform in them -- so it is exported under
the binders the recognizer's three telescopes opened, and closing them at a base point is the
consumer's business. Each level takes the context its telescope was entered at, and hands the
next level the context it opened; the `Expr`-level variables travel along because that is what
lets the equations be stated without computing de Bruijn indices for them here.
-/

/-- Innermost: the induction hypothesis is the recursor at the lower fuel, applied to the smaller
argument and its `Dom` proof. `natRec` and `tg` come from two levels up, where `go`'s own
telescope bound them. Like `lambdaTelescope.Inv`, each level is indexed by the base context and
the `MLCtx` its telescope was entered at, rather than by the `VContext` that pair builds: `Inv`
is indexed that way, and re-wrapping `withMLC` at every level only obscures that the environment
never changes. -/

so no consumer could ever supply it. The instantiation therefore happens in the block, where the
probe binder is still in scope -- `instDF` at a literal, the conditional rebuilt there, and only

the only reason it exists, so this carries them forward verbatim; the intermediate terms they are
stated at -- `go`, the eager gadget, the fuel, the proof argument -- are the block's own and get
existentially quantified along with their translations.

The variable the block binds is quantified by the caller, not here: `ca` is already the extended
context and `a` is the variable. That is what makes the checks exportable at all -- they are plain
`Prop`s about a context the proof may keep naming after the *code*'s local context is reset.

Only the first two checks are recorded so far. The eager-gadget equation and the `go` step equation
live under further binders (the probe's `x`, and the three telescopes below it) and get their own
nested existentials as those blocks are discharged. -/

/-- The recognizer's own half: it returns a bundle, and the unfolding facts hold of it. This is
the plumbing -- tracking translations through `lambdaTelescope`, `whnfCore`, `unfoldDefinition`
and the `withApp` destructuring, and turning the checked defeq tests into the fields of
`NatFixUnfold`. It is independent of the fuel induction, which is `NatFixUnfold.reflects`.

`vb` is the precondition left behind by moving `Condition.bool.check` out to the callers: the
`eager` gadget is recognized by comparing against `Condition.bool.ite`, and nothing here
verifies that conditional any more. `WF_ite` quantifies over context extensions, which is what
lets it be used here: the comparison happens under the measure telescope, the `a` binder and the
probe, three binders past the `c` the caller checked at.

Two things this proof should do, worked out before writing it and recorded here because the
facts it collects -- the fixpoint, its `Nat.rec` unrolling, the `eager` gadget, the measure
function -- are local variables of the proof and never appear in a statement.

*The packer is used applied, never as an abstraction.* The recognizer finds the packed argument
as a term `a₀` and returns `lctx.mkLambda fvs a₀`, so the two have to be reconciled by beta
somewhere -- and `mkLambda` is not a homomorphism for application, which is what forced closing
substitutions in the first place. Do it here, once, and state everything else in terms of the
packer *applied* to the telescope: `ProbeBundle.applied` already gives the translation of
`mkAppN pack sub` as `pack'` applied, so that is the form everything downstream is in. Same for
the value and the measure, which are lifted over the telescope and applied to its variables, so
that closing turns the application into the ground recursion arguments and absorbs the lift
(`VExpr.liftN_subst`).

*Close the telescope per base point.* The induction needs `go` to be the same functional at every
recursion argument, and `go` may mention the telescope -- the recognizer checks only `F`. So
close the telescope at `σ b` for a base point `b` and derive `NatFixUnfold.step` there; it is
uniform in the argument it is used at because the recognizer verifies the `go` equation with
every argument of `go` still bound. `entry` at `a` fixes the base point to `a`, which is the one
`reflects` runs the induction at. `lambdaTelescope.Inv` supplies the closing (its domains and
`VExpr.lams_appN`), and `hσm` supplies the arguments' typing, which is what makes that closing a
`VEnv.Ctx.SubstEq`. -/

/-- Verification boundary for the well-founded recursion recognizer.

The unfolding facts are `NatFixUnfold'`, but the `probe` half cannot be folded into it: `probe`
runs the caller's right-hand-side builder under a binder it introduces, so its specification has
to quantify over that builder's behaviour. `probe` returns `Unit`, so there is nowhere to put the
equation it establishes except into the builder's own postcondition -- hence the implication into
a caller-chosen `Q`, which is where the caller does the instantiation it wants.

`e` and `meas` live in `c` and the recognizer opens its telescope internally, so no context
manipulation appears here at all -- the recursion telescope is instantiated by *application*
and `c`'s own binders by a closing substitution `γ`, leaving a ground statement. The probes'
contexts are built on top of `c` and are the business of `probe.WF`.

`R` is quantified after `γ`, which is what lets the answer depend on the closing: `Nat.bitwise`
is checked with its operator still a variable of `c`, and only a closing says which `Bool`
operation that variable stands for. -/
