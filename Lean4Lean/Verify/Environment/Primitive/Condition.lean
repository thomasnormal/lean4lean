/-! ### Conditionals

A `Condition` packages a decidable predicate with the evidence that its decision procedure
agrees with `ite`; `Condition.check` verifies that evidence and `Condition.ite`/`dite`/`decide`
build conditionals out of it. `Condition.WF` below is the model-side reading of those checks --
one field per group of checks -- and is the whole of what a caller gets to use.

Two things are pulled out of the raw checks rather than transcribed.

*The context.* Everything is stated in the empty context. A `Condition` is a closed constant of
the checker (`natLE`, `natEq`, `bool`), so nothing it says depends on where the check runs, and
a ground fact weakens to any context with `weak0`. `Nat.mod` and `Nat.div` already call
`Condition.check` before their first `withLocalDecl`; the calls in `Nat.bitwise` and in
`unfoldNatWellFounded`'s `eager` gadget currently sit under binders, but neither mentions
anything local, so both can be hoisted. Without that hoisting these statements would have to
carry the check's context and a weakening along it, for no gain.

*The decision.* What varies between the three conditions is not the `ite` equations -- those
are the same shape -- but when the decision procedure is known to evaluate. That is `decides`,
a parameter here and a separate fact per condition: `bool` decides its own scrutinee, while
`natLE` and `natEq` decide by `asBool`, which their branches' guards make a reflected
primitive (`Nat.ble`, `Nat.beq`). Keeping it a parameter is what lets the two `ite`/`dite`
fields be shared by all three. -/

/-- `@ite.{1} α p inst t e`, the shape `Condition.ite` builds. -/
def iteApp (α p inst t e : VExpr) : VExpr :=
  (((((VExpr.const ``ite [.succ .zero]).app α).app p).app inst).app t).app e

/-- `@dite.{1} Nat p inst t e`, the shape `Condition.dite` builds. The branches are functions of
the decision -- `Nat.mod` and `Nat.div` really do use it, as the `1 ≤ y` argument to `go`. -/
def diteApp (p inst t e : VExpr) : VExpr :=
  (((((VExpr.const ``dite [.succ .zero]).app .nat).app p).app inst).app t).app e

/-- A `Reflection` together with its translation. `type'` and `toDec'` are carried rather than
existentially bound per fact because `WF_ite` and `WF_dite` are equations about both of them.
The one field beyond the translations is `Reflection.check`. -/

  htype : c.TrExprS r.type type'
  /-- `Reflection.check`: the reflection is a relation between a proposition and a boolean. -/
  typeT : c.HasType type' vexpr(Prop → Bool → Prop)

/-- What is known about `toDec`'s type: applied to a proposition, a boolean and evidence relating
them, it is well typed.

*Applied*, because that is all anything checks. `Reflection.check` does not check `toDec`'s type
-- `toDec` is only ever *used*, inside `ite`/`natDITE`, and it is those uses, whose binders are a
`Prop`, a `Bool` and a `type p b`, that pin its argument types. A typing obtained at someone
else's binders does not reassemble into a pi type, and the codomain is pinned by nothing at all.

*Not a field of `Reflection.WF`*, because only the two optional checks establish it. It is what
`ITE_T`/`DITE_T` deliver on the side, and every consumer of it -- the two bridges below -- runs
under one of those flags anyway. -/

/-- The pi types of the three functions in `toDec`'s spine, each with the domain its argument was
given. Congruence in an argument needs exactly this, and `app_inv` is the whole proof: the
domains are not identified with `Prop`/`Bool`/`type p b` here because a consumer that has to
convert an argument does it against the type it has anyway. -/

/-- `Reflection.checkITE`: at reflection evidence for a boolean literal, `ite` on the decision
the reflection produces is the corresponding branch.

Quantified over the context, unlike the fields above. Those are about the reflection's own closed
pieces, which live at `[]` and weaken; this is about the *caller's* proposition, evidence and
branches, which live past whatever binders the caller has opened, and a `c`-level statement could
not be transported to them. The check itself is run under two `withLocalDecl`s at closed types,
so it holds at every context by weakening and instantiating those two binders. -/

/-- The extra content of `Condition.check` at `ite := true`: `Condition.ite` at translated,
well-typed pieces translates, and to the `iteApp` of the condition's own pieces on the nose --
the same shape `WF_dite` has. Naming the translation rather than existentially quantifying it is
what lets `IteEval` be the *only* evaluation statement: a caller that built its conditional here
and one that reached an `iteApp` by closing off probe variables are asking about the same term,
so there is no reason for the two to have separate equations.

Positive rather than an elimination: the caller is *building* the equation body out of these,
and gets to assemble its translation from the pieces instead of taking one apart afterwards.
`Condition.decide` is `ite` at `Bool`, so it needs no clause of its own.

Quantified over an arbitrary well-formed `MLCtx`, not stated at `c`. Being positive is exactly
what forces this: the callers apply it to *their* pieces, and those live past whatever binders
they have opened -- the `eager` gadget's conditional is compared under a `withLocalDecl` and a
probe, so its `args` and branches mention fvars that do not exist at `c`. A `c`-level statement
could not be transported to them, since weakening moves a fixed term into a bigger context and
these terms are not in the smaller one. The burden lands on `Condition.check.WF`, which has it
either way: the pieces it supplies itself (`cnd.prop`, `cnd.dec`) are closed by `Condition.OK`,
so `TrExprS.weakFV_inv` and `TrExprS.of_nil` move them to any context.

The sort of `α` is asked for only when `natOnly` is false, and that is not a convenience. Nothing
in the model pins `Nat`'s universe: `HasPrimitives` records that the constructors are present,
not the declared type, and a bogus environment could put `Nat` at any sort, so no caller at
`α = Nat` can produce `Nat : Type 0`. The `natOnly` case does not need it -- it reads the whole
`ite` off the `checkType natITE` check, which the checker ran at `Nat` -- while a `reflectNatNat`
instantiates `checkITE`'s `∀ α : Type, α → α → α` and genuinely does. -/

branches are functions of the decision -- `Nat.mod` and `Nat.div` really do use it, as the

instantiates them.

The proof is existential. The caller never inspects it, proof irrelevance makes any proof of
the decided proposition do, and which one the checker produces depends on the `Reflection`'s
`ofTrue`/`ofFalse`; naming it here would leak those into every use site. -/

/-- `WF_dite` at the level of the model: the same equation, about a `diteApp` the caller has
already built out of the condition's `prop` and `dec` rather than about `Condition.dite`'s
translation.

A caller that *builds* its conditional as an `Expr` wants `WF_dite`. The fuel recursions want
this: they reach their conditionals by closing off the checker's probe variables, and a closing
acts on `VExpr`s, so by then there is no `Expr` left to talk about. The branches are functions
rather than open terms for the same reason -- that is what a closed `Condition.dite` substitutes
to. -/

/-- The `ite` equation, exactly as `DiteEval` is to `WF_dite`: the conditional built out of the
condition's own `prop` and `dec` collapses to the branch its decision selects. This is the only
`ite` evaluation there is. `WF_ite` names the term a source-level caller built, and this says
what that term is worth, wherever it has since been carried to -- `Nat.mod`'s outer conditional
is reached by closing off probe variables, and `Nat.bitwise`'s operator only decides once a
closing has instantiated it, so neither is still an `Expr` by the time it is evaluated.

`natOnly` restricts it to `α' = Nat`, for the same reason it restricts `WF_ite`: the `.bool`
condition reads its whole conditional off the `checkType natITE` check, which the checker ran at
`Nat`, so that is the only type it can speak about. A `reflectNatNat` instantiates `checkITE`'s
`∀ α : Type, α → α → α` and is unrestricted -- which is what `Condition.decide`, an `ite` at
`Bool`, needs. -/

/-! ### Transport to a context with more binders *outside*

`TrExprS.of_nil` moves a `[]`-level translation to another context, but only one with no bound
variables: `VLCtx.FVLift` extends by free variables. The reflection's checks are run at terms
whose binders are *bound*, so the same closed subterm (`toDec`, `type`) is read once at `[]` and
once four binders deep, and nothing identifies the two readings.

Appending on the right is the missing move. It adds binders *outside* everything, so no de Bruijn
index shifts and the translation is unchanged: `find?` returns before it reaches the appended
part, and the typing side conditions weaken by `IsDefEq.weakR`. -/

/-- **A closed term is read the same way wherever it is read.** `weakR` adds context to a
reading; this removes it, which is the direction every closed piece of a `Condition` needs.
`Condition.check` reads them under the gadget's binders, `Reflection.checkITE` under its own, and
only a reading at the base context can identify the two -- so with this, no check has to exist
merely to produce that reading.

The prefix `pre` is what the term's *own* binders push, so it is shared by the two sides and its
shape is never inspected: a lookup either lands in it, and then agrees on both sides, or the term
was not closed. What does have to travel is the typing side conditions, which live at the wider
context; they come down by `weakN_iff`, which needs the subterm closed, so closedness is proved
in the same induction. The types those side conditions carry are *not* preserved, and need not
be -- `TrExprS` quantifies them existentially, so re-deriving some type at the narrower context
is enough, which `app_inv`/`lam_inv` do from the node's own well-formedness. -/

which is what makes the gadget the decision procedure the `e ≡ dec` check compares against.

The typings are proved under the gadget's own two `Nat` binders and moved to the consumer's
arguments by `genTeleT`; the inner beta step likewise travels by `genTele`, while the outer one
is done at the consumer's context directly, since that is where its argument typings live. -/

/-- The whole content of `checkType e`, for the gadget

    e = fun x y : Nat => (fun (p : Prop) (b : Bool) (H : type p b) => toDec p b H)
          (prop x y) (asBool x y) (proof x y)

*Its translation* determines the three pieces': they are read under the gadget's two `Nat`
binders, and `TrExprS.ofClosed` brings those readings down to `[]`, where the rest of the
development lives. So `Condition.check` needs no check of its own for `prop`, `asBool` or
`proof` -- reading them is what the gadget already does.

*Its typing* determines their types. That is what the beta-redex is for: the arguments are
checked against binders that name `Prop`, `Bool` and `type p b`, so a gadget that type checks at
all has pieces of those types, and has them consistent with each other -- which a separate check
of `proof` could assert but not tie to `prop` and `asBool`. Written as the application
`toDec (prop x y) (asBool x y) (proof x y)` it would instead be `toDec`'s *own* type that pinned
them, and nothing checks that: `toDec` is only ever used, inside `ite`/`natDITE`.

Everything is exported at an arbitrary context and arbitrary arguments, since that is where a
consumer needs it: `genTeleT` moves the typings, and the two beta steps -- one per redex -- are
what turns the gadget applied to two naturals into `toDec` at the three pieces. -/
