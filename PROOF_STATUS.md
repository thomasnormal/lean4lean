# Non-inductive verification proof of concept

This fork is an incomplete, conditional verification checkpoint, not a proof of
all of Lean. The intended review branch is `poc-verified-noninductive`.

## What is proved

- `addDeclVerified.WF` preserves environment well-formedness and extension for
  successful checked declarations. Its entry point supports axioms, definitions,
  theorems, opaque declarations, unsafe/partial mutual definitions, and a checked
  quotient wrapper; it explicitly rejects inductives.
- `VEnvs.WF.empty`, `addDeclVerified.foldlM_WF`, and
  `addDeclVerified.fromEmpty` provide initialization and composition for finite
  declaration sequences. These are partial-correctness statements: they do not
  promise that checking any particular declaration succeeds.
- The replacement level normalizer preserves evaluation. The comparison core
  agrees with upstream `geq.go`, and the public comparison/equivalence tests are
  sound. Exact syntactic agreement of the entire normalizer with upstream is
  regression-tested, not proved.
- `NatAddSpec.eval` derives literal addition from the checked open zero/successor
  equations. The primitive-check bridge supplies those equations, and the
  declaration proof reconstructs addition reflection in the extended environment.
  The bridge uses the old environment's primitive invariant, not the invariant it
  is trying to establish. The native addition reduction is enabled again.
- `NatMulSpec.eval` derives literal multiplication from its zero/successor
  equations and typed addition reflection. Multiplication's primitive-check and
  environment-extension proofs are connected, and its native reduction is also
  enabled. `HasPrimitives` now records the function types of addition and
  multiplication as well as their literal evaluation: the type information is
  needed when checking equations that use already-declared primitives on variables.
- `NatPowSpec.eval` derives exponentiation from its checked equations and typed
  multiplication reflection. Its declaration-extension proof and native reduction
  are connected. The equation proof covers all natural exponents; the native
  reduction retains its existing `2^24` exponent limit.
- `NatPredSpec.eval` and `NatSubSpec.eval` derive predecessor and truncated
  subtraction from their checked equations. Both declaration-extension proofs
  are connected, and native subtraction is restored. The environment invariant
  records predecessor's typed evaluation and the function types needed by later
  primitives. A shared extension lemma preserves the unchanged primitives.

Main review entry points: `Lean4Lean/Verify/Environment.lean`,
`Lean4Lean/Verify/Primitive.lean`, and `Lean4Lean/Verify/Level.lean`.

## What this does not establish

- The frontend and primitive-check bridge still inherit `sorryAx` from the
  existing verification/metatheory stack. Even the empty-environment theorem's
  axiom audit includes it. No claim of unconditional kernel soundness is made.
- `AddInduct` still has no constructors. There is no verified translation of the
  actual Lean prelude, and the restricted frontend cannot bootstrap `Nat`/`Bool`
  inductives. Arithmetic results are conditional on an appropriate starting
  environment translation; runtime tests against the imported prelude do not
  construct that translation.
- Native binary reductions other than addition, multiplication, exponentiation,
  and subtraction remain disabled.
  Restoring them with their primitive-extension proofs is unfinished work, not
  an optional optimization that can be dropped from the objective. The checker
  now passes the earlier recursion failure in `Lean4Lean.Verify.Level`, but
  replay still fails with a deterministic timeout in `Lean.Level.mkData_depth`.
- The unrestricted `addDecl.WF` and the existing inductive/injectivity/
  strengthening obligations remain open. The experimental subsumption algorithm
  is not the verified public level-comparison path.

This is a modified executable, not merely new proofs about an unchanged checker:
it includes the restricted frontend, additional primitive validation, safe-only
delta unfolding, the level replacement, and the reduced native-arithmetic set.
Those behavioral changes need review alongside the proofs.

## Reproduction and evidence

Using the pinned toolchain, the package was rebuilt from clean generated outputs
(dependency build caches retained):

```sh
lake clean lean4lean
lake build Lean4Lean.Theory Lean4Lean.Verify lean4lean
lake env lean tests/Environment.lean
lake env lean tests/Primitive.lean
lake env lean --run tests/Levels.lean
lake env .lake/build/bin/lean4lean Lean4Lean.Verify.Primitive
lake env .lake/build/bin/lean4lean Lean4Lean.Verify.Environment
```

The tests cover acceptance/rejection from an empty environment, rejection of
incorrect arithmetic implementations, large literal arithmetic with low fuel,
subtraction truncation at zero, both sides of the native exponent-limit boundary, and
agreement with upstream on 3,280 small normalizations and 10,000 generated level
cases. The executable successfully replayed 114 declarations in the primitive
verification module and 300 in the environment verification module.
This is module replay against imported dependencies, not a
verified replay of the entire dependency closure.

`#print axioms` reports only `propext` and `Quot.sound` for
`Lean4Lean.VEnv.NatAddSpec.eval`, `.reflects`, `Lean4Lean.VEnv.NatMulSpec.eval`,
`Lean4Lean.VEnv.NatPowSpec.eval`, `Lean4Lean.VEnv.NatPredSpec.eval`, and
`Lean4Lean.VEnv.NatSubSpec.eval`. The shared
`Lean4Lean.VEnv.HasPrimitives.extendPrimitive` lemma has the same axiom set.
The level soundness theorems
`Lean.Level.normalizeCore_eval`, `geq'_wf`, and `isEquiv'_wf` use the standard
logical axioms and the existing `Lean.Level.instLawfulBEqLevel` interface axiom,
without `sorryAx`. The frontend audit includes `sorryAx` and the existing
implementation-interface axioms, as noted above.
